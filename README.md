# panthera

> Hic sunt leones

Latin phrase reported on many maps indicating *Terra incognita*, unexplored or harsh land.

## What

Dataframes in Clojure. Through [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas). On Python.

## Disclaimer

This is very alpha, things will change fast, will break and the API is neither complete, nor settled. Since a few people have started playing with this there's a Clojars project available. Please give feedback if you're using this, every kind of contribution is appreciated (for more info check the [Contributing](#contributing) section). At the moment everything is mostly undocumented and untested, I'm currently adding them.

## Get started

**Panthera** uses the great [libpython-clj](https://github.com/cnuernber/libpython-clj) as a backend to access Python and get [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) functionality. 

To get started you need python, pandas and numpy (the latter comes with the former) on your path. Usually a:

```bash
apt-get install libpython3.6-dev
pip3 install numpy pandas xlrd # the latter is for Excel files, if you don't care you can do without
```

After this you can start playing around with **panthera**

```clojure
(require '[panthera.panthera :as pt])

(-> (pt/read-csv "mycsv.csv")
    (pt/subset-cols "Col1" "Col2" "Col3")
    pt/median)
```

The above chain will read your csv file as a DataFrame, select only the given columns and then return a Series with the median of each column.

`panthera.panthera` is the home of the main API, and you can find everything there. The advice is to never `:use` or `:refer :all` the namespace because there are some functions named as core Clojure functions such as `mod` which in this case does the same thing as the core one, but in this case it is vectorized and it works only if the first argument is a Python object.

All of the main numpy is wrapped and accessible through a single interface from `panthera.numpy`.

```clojure
(require '[panthera.numpy :refer [npy]])

(npy :power {:args [[1 2 3] 3]})
;=> [1 8 27]

(npy :power)
; This arity returns the actual numpy object that can be passed around to other functions as an argument
```

For every function there is a key, to check everything that is available just call the zero-arity version - `(npy)` - and you'll get a list of keys. To see how they work either check the [official docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) online or call `(npy :your-key {:doc true})` to check the original Python docstring.

This is because while **panthera.panthera** is carefully wrapped method by method, but it's so large that at the moment just 35%-40% of its functionality is covered, I wanted all of numpy available, so the wrapper is fully automatically generated.

Numpy submodules (like random and linalg) will follow soon.
